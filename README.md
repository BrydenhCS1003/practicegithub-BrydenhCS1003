# CS 1003 - Practicing with GitHub

This is a practice assignment for you to get 
used to GitHub. Just like an assignment or lab 
you will update the provided files, and add your 
details to your README.md file.

Don't mess around with other files... you can't do 
any real damage, but it might stop your project
from working.

- Have a look at the hello.py file. 
- Update with your own name. 
- Fill in the details below.

Click on the "Commit" on the left-hand bar.
After you have saved your changes you should 
able to check off the ```hello.py``` and ```README.md```
files. 

Next, fill in a commit message, something like 
"completed practicing with GitHub".

Finally, click "Commit and Push..." 

That's it you did it. You can go on the GitHub 
website to verify that your project has been
committed correctly.
